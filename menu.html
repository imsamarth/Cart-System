                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Appetizers</h2>
                <p class="center">“By some people the meal itself is a long delay between the appetizer and the dessert” - Gertrude Berg

                    The ideal course for sharing and sampling more adventurous flavors, an appetizer can be a great way of adding a touch of flair to a menu without adding to the amount of time spent in the kitchen.
                    
                    The ideal appetizer is simple and tasty, served in smaller portions to ensure guests don’t fill up before the main event, while showcasing local favorites or seasonal ingredients. We also love the simplicity of being able to add a new twist to an old classic, taking familiar appetizers to new heights.
                    
                    Whether you are looking for an evening showstopper to impress your guests, that little something extra to complement your main course, or some finger food to keep the hordes in check, you’ll find it all here.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Main Course</h2>
                <p class="center">“Anyone can make you enjoy the first bite of a dish, but only a real chef can make you enjoy the last.” - Francois Minot

                    Regardless of the type of cuisine, the main dish should always be the plat de resistance, a soul-warming meal that will keep the bigger appetites circling for seconds. A well planned main course should be anticipated, and aim to satisfy and delight the diner. This is usually the heartiest or most filling dish of a meal, whether you are entertaining a crowd or making dinner for two.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Salad</h2>
                <p class="center">“To make a good salad is to be a brilliant diplomatist - the problem is entirely the same in both cases. To know how much oil one must mix with one’s vinegar.” - Oscar Wilde

                    The most versatile of dishes, salads are an emblem of hospitality. Generous and filled with appetizing combinations of fruits, vegetable, meats, grains, legumes, noodles, and nuts there is without the shadow of a doubt a salad combination to please even the most demanding palate.
                    
                    One of the most healthy and simplest habits to cultivate, incorporating salads into your daily regimen allows for a mix of colors, textures, and flavors to keep you feeling satisfied and living longer. Simply remember that a little dressing goes a long way.

                <p class="center">“Life itself is the proper binge.” - Julia Child

                    Think of snacks as mini versions of a meal, with varied ingredients, that provide energy and curb hunger cravings. We encourage eating whole foods that will both taste yummy and keep your tummy happy. A balanced diet can include 2 to 3 snacks a day. Think about including food groups that might have been missing from your meals that day like nuts, dairy, fruits, legumes, or vegetables.</p>

                <p class="center">“I don’t cry over spilt milk, but a fallen scoop of ice cream is enough to ruin my whole day” - Terri Guillemets
